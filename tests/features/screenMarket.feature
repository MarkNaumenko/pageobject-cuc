Feature: Take screenshot of recent prices
    As a user
    I want to know prices of some items on the market
    
	# Scenario: Check F1 2016 has multiplayer
 #    	Given I am on the market page
 #    	When I will input 'F1 2016' in the search field
 #    	Then I will go to the page of this 'F1 2016' game
 #    	Then check 'Multi-player' feature
 #    	Then I will wait a bit
